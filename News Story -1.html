        <p> Teachers from all buildings participated in Reading Horizons Elevate training. Reading Horizons Elevate is a reading intervention program for students in grades 4-12. When older learners have reading difficulties it is often because they have gaps in the foundational decoding skills needed for fluent reading. The Reading Horizons ElevateÂ® program helps older learners fill these gaps with assessment-driven explicit phonics instruction based on the principles of reading science. Teachers are now equipped with the materials and the training they need to provide intervention based on the science of reading. </p>
